You might be familiar with the story in the Book of Mormon of the stripling warriors. 2,000 young men form a small army in order to protect their land and defend their parents, who had covenanted with God to never pick up arms again. Did you know, though, that there were actually 2,060 warriors? Let's take a look at these extra warriors and what we can learn from them.

In [[Alma 53]], we read that 2,000 young men from the people of Ammon make a covenant with God to protect their homes and families. With their commander, Helaman, the army works to protect some Nephite cities against Lamanite attacks. As they rest and prepare for another battle, another 60 young warriors arrive to bolster Helaman's army. In the aftermath of the next battle, Helaman is overjoyed to find that not a single one of his young warriors has been killed in the battle; all of them, including the 60 who arrived late, have been blessed with strength and protection because of their faith and the covenant they made.

Sometimes, we might feel that we've missed some sort of spiritual deadline. We didn't repent or act soon enough, and we've missed out on the forgiveness and the blessings that the Lord has promised us. I personally felt this way after graduating high school and not wanting to serve a mission. I went to college and was inactive for a couple of years. I was lacking spritual strength and preparedness. After working with the missionaries for a few months and attending church again, I received a strong impression to serve a mission and did so. The Lord blessed me without measure on my mission, and I have no doubt that He guided me during my time of service.

We don't know why the 60 stripling warriors arrived late to join their brethren. Maybe their priorities weren't in line, or maybe they weren't spiritually prepared yet. As soon as they arrived, though, they were welcomed into Helaman's army. They were able to help out in the battle against the Lamanites, and we know the Lord was pleased with their service because they were protected the same as all the other warriors.

We don't need to compare ourselves or the rate of our progress to others. The Lord knows who we are, what our spiritual state is, and what we're capable of. If we're willing to make the sacrifices He asks of us, even if we feel it's "late", He will bless us with the full measure of the blessings He has promised us.

This is exemplified in one of the parables that Christ shares in the New Testament. In [[Matthew 20.1-16]], Christ describes a man who goes out seeking laborers to work in his vineyard. He promises the laborers a penny a day (a fair wage in this story), and they begin to work. At various times through the day, he goes out and hires more laborers to help, promising them a fair wage. He even hires some workers when there is only an hour of the workday left. At the end of the day, he pays all of the workers the full day's wages, regardless of how much time they actually worked.

Christ knows when He calls us, and He is perfectly just and merciful. He sees us as who we can one day become, and He is patient and willing to give us all the blessings that He has promised if we are willing to truly repent and dedicate ourselves to His work. The 60 late stripling warriors received the same blessings of strength and protection as the other young warriors, even though they arrived late. Christ is willing to do the same for us. If you are worried that you have missed your chance for repentance, or that you have missed your opportunity to join in the Lord's work, I promise you that you have not. The Lord's atonement is infinite in its reach and power. Turn to Christ, and He will bless you without measure.
