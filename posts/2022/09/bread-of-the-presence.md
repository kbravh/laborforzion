There are many elements of the [[Tabernacle of Moses]] that have rich symbolic meaning that teach of the plan of salvation. To the right of the entrance inside of the tent lay the table of shewbread, also known as the bread of the presence. On the table rested twelve loaves of bread, representative of the twelve tribes of Israel being in the presence of God.

This shewbread was a predecessor or symbol of the sacrament, with the bread representing Christ's body as it does in the full sacrament ordinance. A few clues about the shewbread help tie it to Christ's body:
* As Christ will represent mankind before God at judgement day, so does this bread stand in to represent the twelve tribes of Israel before God in the temple.
* The cakes were unleavened and baked on the Friday before the sabbath - a close parallel to the timing of Christ's great sacrifice.
* **Frankincense** was placed in the cups on top of the piles of bread. All of the utensils were made of **gold**. The table was consecrated with oil and **myrrh**. These were the three gifts the wise men brought to Jesus at his birth.
